(** The return type of live evaluation and resumption.
    Live evaluation and resumption may fail (e.g., by running out of fuel), in
    which case they will return a {!type:string} describing the error that
    occurred. *)

val eval : env -> exp -> eval_result
(** [eval env exp] live evaluates the expression [exp] in the environment
    [env]. *)

val resume : hole_filling -> res -> eval_result
(** [resume hf res] resumes the result [res] with the hole-filling [hf]. *)
