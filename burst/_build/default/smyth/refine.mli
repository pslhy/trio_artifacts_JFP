val refine :

    -> (exp * fill_goal list) option
    (** [refine delta sigma goal] splits the synthesis goal [goal] into subgoals
        based on type-and-example-directed refinement.

        Type-and-example-directed refinement is deterministic but may fail;
        hence, this function returns an {!option}. *)
