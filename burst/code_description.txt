In this we describe the layout of the code.

The smyth directory is used for comparisons to Smyth.

The app directory contains the code for the Command line interface. It also
contains the code that calls Smyth.

The src directory contains the Burst tool. The remainder of this description is
about code in that directory.

The Synthesizers.ml file describes provides module signatures for synthesis
engines. PredicateSynth describes the type of synthesizers on ground formulas.
VerifiedPredicate is a functor that performs a CEGIS loop to synthesize from
arbitrary logical predicates. The ``Verifier'' we use in this loop is an
enumerative verifier (in EnumerativeVerfier.ml).

The majority of our synthesis engine is in the files CrazyFTASynthesizer.ml and
FTAConstructor.ml. The CrazyFTASynthesizer encodes the full synthesis loop. The
core loop is in the function: synthesize. The function: construct_full performs
the core BuildAngelicFTA function. FTAConstructor is used to actually build up
the concrete FTA, and keeps track of what states are in the automaton.
Essentially, it helps build up the FTA according to the inference rules in
Figure 9.
