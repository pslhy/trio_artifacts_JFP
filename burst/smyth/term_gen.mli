(** Efficient type-directed guessing consistent with {b Figure 17} of the ICFP
    2020 paper (Appendix A).

    This module uses extensive memoization and other efficiency techniques, so
    the implementation looks nothing like {b Figure 17} of the ICFP 2020 paper.
    See Section 7.3.4 of Peter-Michael Osera's PhD thesis for details about
    how efficient raw-term enumeration is achieved in {e Myth} (the details of
    which transfer readily to {e Smyth}).

    {b Warning:} this module uses mutation to manage the memoization cache.
    See {!clear_cache}. *)
