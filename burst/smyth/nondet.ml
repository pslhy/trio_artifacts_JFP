(* Construction *)

let none =
  []

let from_list xs =
  xs

(* Collection *)

let to_list xs =
  xs

(* Core functions *)

let map =
  List.map

let pure =
  List2.pure

let join =
  List.concat

(* Generic library functions *)

let pure_bind xs f =
  map f xs

let bind xs f =
  map f xs
    |> join

let and_then f xs =
  bind xs f

let guard b =
  if b then pure () else none

(* Specific library functions *)

let union =
  List.concat

let one_of_each =
  List2.sequence

let is_empty xs =
  xs = none

let filter =
  List.filter

let dedup xs =
  List.sort_uniq compare xs

let collapse_option =
  List2.filter_somes

let take =
  List2.take

let curb_overflow n xs =
  if List.compare_length_with xs n > 0 then
    none
  else
    xs

(* Lifting *)

let lift_option op =
  collapse_option [op]

let lift_result r =
  Result2.to_option r
    |> lift_option

(* Syntax *)
